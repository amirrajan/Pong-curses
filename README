Pong-curses

Pong-curses is a PingPong game written in C with NCURSES lib. I did it when i was in my first year of my major. So maybe is
too simple. The reason because i did this repository is to try github. But if you want to help me to make a better code,
i'll be glad.

!!How to compile!!

You maybe have to install ncurses library. So to install tip:

	$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev 

Go to its directory and tip:

	$ cc pong.c -lncurses -o pong 

Then:

	$ ./pong
