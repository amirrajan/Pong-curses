EasyPong

The original EasyPong was the first version that i did. I did in my fisrt semester of my major. Is too simple and at the same time there is noob code. But i think that maybe can help. It were helped me if i had when i didnt know how to use NCURSES.

!!How to compile!!

You maybe have to install ncurses library. So to install tip:

	$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev 

Go to its directory and tip:

	$ cc pong.c -lncurses -o pong 

Then:

	$ ./pong
